                  <li>
                      <b>Informal Negotiations. </b>To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (<b>“Dispute”</b>), you and LQ agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to LQ. LQ’s address for such notices is LQ Global Services Private Limited., A-149, LGF, Defence Colony, New Delhi India 110024; Attention: Legal.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      <b>Binding Arbitration.</b>If you and LQ are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the LQ Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted in accordance with the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and LQ may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      <b>Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b> Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in an exclusive jurisdiction of Delhi Courts with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      <b>Location of Arbitration. </b>Arbitration will take place in New Delhi, India. You and LQ agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the Delhi Courts will have exclusive jurisdiction and you and LQ agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
